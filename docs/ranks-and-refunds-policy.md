# Ranks & Refunds Policy

The NETHERGAMES NETWORK ("NetherGames", "we", "us", "our") provides an online store website - store.nethergames.org ("Store") - for its users to purchase products and its associated advantages to use. By using the Store, you are agreeing to this Policy. We have developed this Policy to outline the terms and conditions regarding these products and our policy on refunds.

## Rank Policy

By purchasing ranks from us through the Store, you are purchasing access of control to use virtual items and certain features/privileges on Minecraft servers of our choice. The virtual items are not supplied by us, but by Mojang AB ("Mojang"), the developer of the Minecraft Bedrock Edition game. When you pay to purchase a rank and its associated perks, you are paying the NetherGames Network, not Mojang. Furthermore, we are not affiliated with Mojang or its owning company Microsoft Corporation in any way.

Privileges & features associated with a rank are subject to change at anytime without prior notice to players who currently hold the rank. Players who have a rank are given access to virtual items and cosmetic features on our servers, and purchasing a rank does not necessarily guarantee you a win in every game. The outcome of games are based on your skill, not your rank and its perks.

Purchased ranks are to be used on one account only. You may not purchase one rank and use it across multiple accounts. If you attempt to 'scam' ranks, you will be permanently banned from our services and your rank will be removed. We have the right to terminate purchased ranks from our store if the game or privileges we provide no longer exist, but will stop selling it before it is phased-out. We offer no guarantees to the existence of your purchases, but we do our best to keep the privileges available.

If your rank has been removed from your account without reason, you must provide proof of purchase in order for your rank to be added back onto your account. If you do not provide any proof of purchase, your rank will not be re-added, regardless if we, without reason, removed it from your account.

If a rank or stats transfer token has been purchased, there must be sufficient evidence linking both your new and old accounts for your account data to transfer. Due to privacy & security reasons we cannot transfer account data between usernames if we cannot establish a link between both accounts in our system. In this case, you may be offered the opportunity to prove your account ownership.

## Refund Policy

We provide access to playing on all our Minecraft servers free of charge. We may limit the amount of privileges normal players have, and grant extra privileges to players who purchase a rank. Once you have purchased a rank, it is yours and your order cannot be reversed. We do not offer refunds for change of mind. If you have violated our rules, terms & conditions or policies, that does not entitle you to a refund either, as you agree to this statement and our outlined rules & policies when you use our services.

Ranks are not pay-to-win on our servers, nor do they exempt you from any warning or punishment issued by our staff members. If you are dissatisfied with your rank, we do not offer a refund. Filing a chargeback/dispute request with your credit/debit card provider or PayPal will result in you being permanently banned from all our services and your rank removed. Profits from ranks are used to support service maintenance cost, and we hope that by giving privileges with ranks, you will buy them and help us maintain our services. We try to explain how the rank will benefit you, but these are subject to change at anytime, due to us redeveloping old games and developing new features/games.
