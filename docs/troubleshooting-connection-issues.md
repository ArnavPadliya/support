Are you having problems connecting to the network? Are you getting a high ping? Does it say, "You are already online," "Invalid IP address," or are you stuck on "locating server"? Try these tips below.

1. Try restarting your Minecraft client and your device.
2. If you are using a proxy or VPN service, disable it, and try joining again.
3. Try using a different skin to join (some skins may cause issues and are blocked).
4. Attempt to use a different IP to enter (port 19132):
- ap.nethergames.org
- eu.nethergames.org
- us.nethergames.org
5. Use a different internet connection (i.e. mobile data)
