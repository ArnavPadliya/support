# Skyblock Crates & Enchantments

You can obtain enchantments on Skyblock in the form of "enchantment books" by opening crates. Crates can be opened while in the Skyblock lobby. There are four types of cratesâ€”Vote, Common, Rare & Mythic. You could open the Vote crate if you voted that day, while you only can open the three other crates if you have obtained crate keys through mining. The following special enchantments are available on Skyblock:
