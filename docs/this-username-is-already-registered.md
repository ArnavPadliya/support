# This Username Is Already Registered

Do you need help joining due to your username already being registered?

## Why is this happening?

This happens if you're using an Xbox Gamertag that has previously been used to join NetherGames. We may rename or remove old accounts if they've been inactive for at least a year. However, if the previous holder of the username is an account you own, you may follow Solution A or B, respectively.

## Steps to resolve

### Scenario 1: You've joined NetherGames before

1. Open the [NetherGames Portal](https://portal.nethergames.org)
2. Search for your username
3. If the profile belongs to you, see Solution A or Solution B
4. If the profile does not belong to you, see Solution C

### Scenario 2: You haven't joined NetherGames before

See Solution C

## Solutions

### Solution A: Keep your old profile

1. Sign into Minecraft using your old Xbox account
2. Connect to the server (play.nethergames.org)
3. Sign out from Minecraft, as your username has now changed
4. Join NetherGames on your new account

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
Note: We are unable to transfer data between separate accounts. Stats, friends, islands, ranks, etc., are non-transferable. You may transfer some stats by purchasing a Stats Transfer Key.

### Solution B: Delete your old profile

1. Open the [NetherGames Portal](https://portal.nethergames.org)
2. Press "Login" in the upper-right corner
3. Sign in with the Microsoft credentials for your old account
4. If that worked, choose "Requests" > "Account Deletion"
5. Allow up to 48 hours for your request to be processed
6. Join NetherGames when you've received a confirmation email

### Solution C: "I didn't do it!"

1. Open the [NetherGames Portal](https://portal.nethergames.org)
2. Search for your username
3. Check if the player was last seen over a year ago
