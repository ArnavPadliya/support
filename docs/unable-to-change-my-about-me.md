# Unable to Change My "About Me"

Are you unable to change your "About Me" page in the portal?

We use external APIs to scan all "About Me" values in the portal. We will automatically reject values containing profanity, toxicity, sexually explicit content, threats, or other unwanted content. Usually, we automatically reject offensive content without flagging you, but we cannot catch everything. If you're repeatedly trying to circumvent this filter or succeed, we may ban you from editing your "About Me".
