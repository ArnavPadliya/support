# Skyblock crate keys
In Skyblock, crate keys can be used to obtain In-Game items. There are four types of crate key types:
- Voter Keys
- Common Keys
- Rare Keys
- Mythic Keys

The keys define the quality of the items that are available to be achieved.
Which reward you get within each bracket of key types is based on a loot-table.
The loot table is defines as, the higher the weight, the higher the probability of the item.
Randomised amounts might sometimes be limited or seeded with other player-based values.
Power / Luck values are random between set intervals that increase with key rarity.

The weights defined for each item are as follows:
