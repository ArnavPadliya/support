# Reporting a Player

Before reporting a player, please familiarise yourself with the breachable offences [in-game](https://ngmc.co/vacancies) and on [Discord](https://support.nethergames.org/discord-server-regulations.html).

You can report a player by following these steps:

1. Go to [ngmc.co/request](https://ngmc.co/request)
2. Login with your Microsoft (Xbox) account you use to play Minecraft with (if you're not already logged in)
3. Select "Player Report" for an in-game player report or "Discord Report" to report a user on our Discord server
5. Fill out the details required to make the report

Once submitted, you will receive a update within 7 days to your email address registered on your Xbox account. You can also check the status of your report anytime by viewing your submissions at [ngmc.co/request](https://ngmc.co/request).

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
Do not message staff asking about the status of your report while it is still pending. If your report has passed 7 days without a response, please contact us through Modmail on our Discord server, or through livechat at the bottom of [ngmc.co/request](https://ngmc.co/request).
